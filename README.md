Ruby Rube:

The idea for this project is to build a Rube Goldberg machine utilizing
various patterns and practices of software development.  The task that the machine
performs can be anything although in keeping with the spirit of the Rube Goldberg machine it
should most likely be something very simple.

Instructions:
To run the machine from the command line execute the following command
 with an argument

ruby -I lib bin/ruby_rube argument

Ex. ruby -I lib bin/ruby_rube "I Love Ruby!"

You can also specify the --path option as either 1 or 2

Path 1:
Currently a contestant will climb the ladder, run to the podeum and present the message you pass as argument 2.

Path 2:
Is just a placeholder for now that displays a message
